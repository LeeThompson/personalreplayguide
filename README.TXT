Personal ReplayGuide is a package of Perl scripts designed to provide a local, personal, web-based tvlistings service directly integrated with ReplayTVs running the 5.0 software.   (4.x versions of the software cannot remotely schedule programming.)    ReplayTV support is optional if you're just looking to run your own web based TV listings engine.

If you're looking for a desktop application for TVlistings/ReplayTV integration this is probably overkill and you should probably check out DVArchive 3.0 (or greater).   You can find it at http://www.dvarchive.org.    It is a cross platform Java applet.


Please see INSTALL.TXT for more details and setup instructions.
