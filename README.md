I no longer own or use a ReplayTV so this project will likely not be updated again.   If you wish to take it over completely let me know.

NOTE: The documentation refers to "DataDirect".  This was a free service Zap2it (Tribune Media Services) provided until they had to close it down due to commerical application abuse.    Instead, you can use "Schedules Direct" which is a paid service ($25/year with a 7 day free trial) that should be compatible in XML mode.    To sign up or for more information, please visit: http://www.schedulesdirect.org/


Personal ReplayGuide is a package of Perl scripts designed to provide a local, personal, web-based tvlistings service directly integrated with ReplayTVs running the 5.0 software.   (4.x versions of the software cannot remotely schedule programming.)    ReplayTV support is optional if you're just looking to run your own web based TV listings engine.

Development team: Lee Thompson, Kanji T. Bates, Philip Van Baren, J.M., and Kevin J. Moye.

**This software is not under active development.**
